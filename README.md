The program contains 13 pieces of information about the health of each of the 300 people. 
The data has been divided into two sets - the training set and the test set. Based on the training data,
two heart attack prediction models were built. Then they were tested on a test set, giving the model's effectiveness. 
Both models were compared with each other on this basis.

Models:
- generalized linear model
- decision tree

A detailed description of the data and used models is attached in the files.
